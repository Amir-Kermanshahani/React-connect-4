Project Overview:

This Connect-4 game project aims to provide an interactive and enjoyable gaming experience for users. It includes multiplayer functionality and AI integration, allowing players to compete against each other or challenge an AI opponent. The project incorporates various features and concepts, as outlined below.

Project Features:

Game Board Styling: The individual components of the game board are styled to create an appealing visual representation. CSS is used to enhance the overall look and feel of the game.

Advanced onClickEvents: The project implements advanced onClickEvents to handle user interactions with the game board. These events detect user clicks on specific game cells and trigger appropriate actions.

Styling Techniques: The game utilizes a combination of global stylesheets, dynamic styling based on game states, and inline styling within React components. This approach allows for a flexible and visually engaging user interface.

Props and Destructuring: Data and functionality are efficiently passed between React components using props. Destructuring is employed to access and utilize specific props effectively.

React Children: The game leverages React children to accept and render nested content. This feature enables the creation of reusable components with flexible content structures.

React Key Property and Lifecycle Events: The React key property optimizes rendering performance when dealing with dynamic lists. Lifecycle events are utilized to manage component initialization, updates, and unmounting.

Game Initialization and CSS Variables: The Connect-4 game is appropriately initialized, and CSS variables are employed to manage and customize the game's appearance.

Conditional Rendering: Components or elements are conditionally rendered based on game states or user interactions. This feature enhances the user experience by displaying relevant information at the appropriate times.

Automatic Winner Determination: The Connect-4 game is designed to automatically determine the winner in both multiplayer and AI-based single-player modes. This functionality adds excitement and competitiveness to the game.
